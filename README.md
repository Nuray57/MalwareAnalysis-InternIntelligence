Executive Summary
This report details the analysis of a loader malware, a type of malicious software used
to infiltrate devices and deliver further payloads, such as trojans or stealers. The
malware was distributed through phishing emails using social engineering tactics.
Once executed, the loader collects system information from the victimâ€™s device and
installs additional threats. It employs advanced evasion techniques to bypass
detection and persistence strategies to maintain its foothold within the infected
system. Mitigation measures focus on email security, user awareness, and continuous
monitoring to detect malicious activity.
